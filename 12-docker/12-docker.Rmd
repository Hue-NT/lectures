name: r-base

# Base R container

For our first example, let's fire up a simple container that contains little more than a base R installation.

```{bash}
docker run --rm -ti rocker/r-base
```

This will take a little while to download the first time. But afterwards the container will be ready and waiting for immediate deployment ("instantiation") on your system. 

--

</br>
A quick note on these `docker run` [flags](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/):

- `--rm` Automatically remove the container once it exits (i.e. clean up).
- `-ti` Launch with interactive (`i`) shell/terminal (`t`).
- Type `man docker run` to see a full list of flag options.

--

</br>
To see a list of running containers on your system, in a new terminal window type:

```{bash}
docker ps
```

---

# Base R container (cont.)

Your base R container should have launched directly into R. To exit the container, simply quit R.

```{r}
q()
```

Check that it worked:

```{bash}
docker ps
```

--

</br>

BTW, if you don't want to launch directly into your container's R console, you can instead start it in the bash shell.

```{bash}
docker run --rm -ti rocker/r-base /bin/bash
```

This time to close and exit the container, you need to exit the shell, e.g.

```
root@09dda673a187:/# exit
```

name: rstudio+

# RStudio+ container

The [Rocker Project](https://www.rocker-project.org/) works by layering Docker images on top of each other in a [grouped stack](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker#use-cases).


An important group here is the [versioned stack](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker#versioned-stack-builds-on-r-ver) that includes RStudio.
- For example, the "rstudio" image builds on top of the "r-ver" image (which itself is a versioned "r-base" image). 

I'm going to collectively refer to images in this stack as **RStudio+**.
- It's not that each image in the stack contains exactly the same things...
- But they do share some important common features that will make the RStudio+ shorthand convenient for these lecture slides.


--

Everyone clear on what I mean by "RStudio+"? Good. 

---

# RStudio+ container (cont.)

Let's try the "tidyverse" image, which is basically base R + RStudio + tidyverse packages. 

Again, this will take a minute or three to download and extract the first time. But it will be ready for immediate deployment in the future.

--

```{bash}
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=mypassword rocker/tidyverse
```

If you run this... nothing seems to happen. Don't worry, I'll explain on the next slide. 

--
name:username

But first, two quick asides on usernames/passwords:

- All RStudio+ images in the Rocker stack require a password. Pretty much anything you want except "rstudio", which is the default username...
- If you don't like the default "rstudio" username, you can choose your own by adding `-e USER=myusername` to the above command (the extra `-e` flag is required).

---

# RStudio+ container (cont.)

Unlike, the "r-base" container, this time we aren't immediately taken to our R environment. **Reason:** Our container is running RStudio Server, which needs to be opened up in a browser.

So we need to point our browsers to the relevant IP address (plus the assigned `8787` port):
- **Linux:** `http://localhost:8787` 
- **Mac/Windows:** Get your IP address by typing `$ docker inspect <containerid>  | grep IPAddress` (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46310428)). Alternatively, this IP address was also displayed when you first launched your Docker Quickstart Terminal. E.g. The below user would navigate their browser to `192.168.99.100:8787`.

```
                        ##         .
                  ## ## ##        ==
               ## ## ## ## ##    ===
           /"""""""""""""""""\___/ ===
      ~~~ {~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~ /  ===- ~~~
           \______ o           __/
             \    \         __/
              \____\_______/


docker is configured to use the default machine with `IP 192.168.99.100`
For help getting started, check out the docs at https://docs.docker.com

# RStudio+ container (cont.)

Here's the login-in screen that I see when I navigate my browser to the relevant URL.

# RStudio+ container (cont.)

And here I am in RStudio Server running through Docker! (Pro-tip: Hit F11 to go full-screen.)

---

# RStudio+ container (cont.)

To stop this container, open up a new terminal window and grab the container ID with `$ docker ps` (it will be the first column). Then run:

```{bash}
docker stop <containerid>
```

--

</b>

**Note:** We actually ran this container as a background process, because we used the `-d` flag when we first instantiated it, i.e.

```{bash}
docker run `-d` -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=mypassword rocker/tidyverse
```

If you dropped the `-d` flag and re-ran the above command, your terminal would stay open as an ongoing process. (Try this yourself.)
- Everything else would remain the same. You'd still navigate to `<IPADDRESS>:8787` to log in, etc.
- However, I wanted to mention this non-background process version because it offers another way to shut down the container: Simply type `CTRL+c` in the (same, ongoing process) Terminal window. Again, try this yourself.
- Confirm that the container is stopped by running `$ docker ps`.

# Sharing files with a container

# Share files by mounting volumes

Each container runs in a sandboxed environment and cannot access the files and directories on your computer unless you give it explicit permission.

To share files with a container, the `-v` (mount volume) flag is your friend. 
- Adopts a `LHS:RHS` convention, where `LHS` = `path/on/your/computer/` and `RHS` = `path/on/the/container`.

--

</br>

For example, say I have a folder on my computer located at `/home/grant/coolproject`. I can make this available to my "tidyverse" container by running: 

```{bash}
docker run `-v /home/grant/coolproject:/home/rstudio/coolproject` -d -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=mypassword rocker/tidyverse
```

--

</br>

PS &mdash; I'll get back to specifying the correct RHS path in a couple slides.

---

# coolproject

The coolproject directory is now available from RStudio running on the container.

![](pics/rocker-rstudio-share.png)

---

# Choosing the RHS mount point

In the previous example, I specified the RHS mount point as `/home/rstudio/coolproject`.

How did I know this would work?

--

The short answer is that `/home/rstudio` is the default user's home directory for images in the RStudio+ stack. If you're running a container from this stack, you should almost always start your RHS with this path root.
- Exception: If you assigned a different default user than "rstudio" ([back here](#username)). 

--

OTOH, the `/coolproject` directory name is entirely optional. You could call it anything you want. Giving it the same name as the directory on your computer obviously helps to avoid confusion, though.
- Similarly, nothing is stopping you from adding a couple of parent directories. I could have used `-v /home/grant/coolproject:/home/rstudio/parentdir/coolproject` and it would have worked fine.

---

# Choosing the RHS mount point (cont.)

So, the RHS mount point for RStudio+ containers is (almost) always `/home/rstudio`.

What about other containers?
 - E.g. For r-base containers there's no "rstudio" user so the above definitely won't work. (Fun fact: When you run an r-base container you are actually logged in as root.)

--

In truth, the specific RHS mount point is less important for non-RStudio+ containers.<sup>1</sup> Still, I recommend a general strategy of mounting external volumes on the dedicated `/mnt` directory that is standard on Linux.<sup>2</sup> For example:

```{bash}
docker run -it --rm -v /home/grant/coolproject:/mnt/coolproject r-base
```


.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> It only really matters for the first group because RStudio Server limits how and where users can access files. This is a security feature we'll revisit in the next lecture on cloud computing.

<sup>2</sup> Remember, Docker images are basically just miniaturized, portable Linux OSs.
